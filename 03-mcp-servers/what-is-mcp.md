# What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is an open protocol that enables Claude Code to connect with external tools and data sources, dramatically expanding what Claude can do for you.

## Understanding MCP

Think of MCP as a bridge that allows Claude to:
- 🔌 Connect to external services (GitHub, Slack, databases)
- 📁 Access local resources (files, browsers, system tools)
- 🔧 Use specialized tools (screenshot capture, PDF generation)
- 🌐 Interact with web services (APIs, cloud platforms)

## How MCP Works

```
┌─────────────┐     MCP Protocol      ┌──────────────┐
│ Claude Code │ ◄──────────────────► │  MCP Server  │
│   (Client)  │                       │ (Data/Tools) │
└─────────────┘                       └──────────────┘
      │                                      │
      ▼                                      ▼
   Your Code                           External Service
```

1. **Claude Code** acts as an MCP client
2. **MCP Servers** provide tools and data access
3. **Communication** happens through standardized protocols
4. **You** benefit from expanded capabilities

## Types of MCP Servers

### 1. Local Servers (stdio)
Run on your machine, communicate through standard input/output
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Remote Servers (SSE/HTTP)
Connect to services over the network
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "transport": "sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: GitHub Integration
With the GitHub MCP server, Claude can:
- Create and manage issues
- Review pull requests
- Analyze repository statistics
- Manage workflows

### Example 2: Database Access
Database MCP servers let Claude:
- Query data directly
- Generate reports
- Analyze schemas
- Suggest optimizations

### Example 3: Browser Automation
Playwright/Puppeteer MCP servers enable:
- Web scraping
- Automated testing
- Screenshot capture
- Form filling

## Benefits of Using MCP

### 1. Extended Capabilities
- Access data Claude normally can't reach
- Use tools beyond text processing
- Integrate with your existing workflow

### 2. Real-Time Information
- Get current data from databases
- Access live API endpoints
- Monitor system resources

### 3. Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Chain multiple operations
- Create complex workflows

### 4. Security
- Controlled access through configuration
- Authentication support
- Scoped permissions

## MCP vs Direct API Calls

| Feature | MCP | Direct API |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Setup | One-time configuration | Code for each call |
| Maintenance | Handled by server | Your responsibility |
| Discovery | Automatic | Manual documentation |
| Error Handling | Standardized | Custom implementation |
| Authentication | Built-in support | Manual setup |

## Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Third-Party Servers**: Use at your own risk
2. **Prompt Injection**: Servers can influence Claude's responses
3. **Data Access**: Servers can access configured resources
4. **Authentication**: Always use secure credential storage

### Best Practices

1. **Review Server Code**: Check what servers do before installing
2. **Limit Permissions**: Give servers minimum required access
3. **Use Trusted Sources**: Prefer official or well-known servers
4. **Monitor Activity**: Keep an eye on server operations

## Getting Started with MCP

1. **Identify Your Needs**
   - What external data do you need?
   - Which tools would help your workflow?
   - What integrations make sense?

2. **Choose Servers**
   - Browse available servers
   - Check compatibility
   - Review documentation

3. **Install and Configure**
   - Follow [installation guide](./installing-servers.md)
   - Set up authentication
   - Test functionality

4. **Start Using**
   - Reference resources with `@`
   - Execute server commands
   - Integrate into workflow

## Common Use Cases
