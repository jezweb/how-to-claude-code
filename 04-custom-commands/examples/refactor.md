# Refactor Code

Refactor the specified code to improve quality, maintainability, and performance.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Code Organization**
   - Extract methods for single responsibility
   - Group related functionality
   - Improve file/module structure
   - Remove dead code

2. **Readability**
   - Clarify variable and function names
   - Simplify complex logic
   - Add meaningful comments
   - Improve formatting

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize algorithms
   - Reduce unnecessary computations
   - Improve data structures
   - Minimize memory usage

4. **Maintainability**
   - Reduce coupling
   - Increase cohesion
   - Extract reusable components
   - Standardize patterns

## Refactoring Principles

- ✅ Maintain existing functionality
- ✅ Keep changes incremental
- ✅ Ensure tests pass after each change
- ✅ Document significant changes
- ✅ Preserve or improve performance

## Specific Focus Areas

$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Identify code smells
   - Map dependencies
   - List improvement opportunities
   - Prioritize changes

2. **Refactoring Phase**
   - Make incremental changes
   - Run tests after each change
   - Document modifications
   - Update related code

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Check performance impact
   - Verify functionality preserved
   - Update documentation

## Deliverables
